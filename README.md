## Hi there 

I'm a computer science student at Georgia Tech, focusing on Artificial Intelligence and System Architecture, with a deep interest in the intersection of AI and finance. My academic and professional pursuits revolve around using machine learning and algorithmic strategies to drive innovation in financial markets. Iâ€™m passionate about developing technology that enables smarter, data-driven decisions in asset management, adapting dynamically to real-time market conditions. Outside the classroom, I enjoy staying active - snowboarding and gyming.
